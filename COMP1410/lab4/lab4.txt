code explained:
so for the swap func I take in two pointers of chars I then create a temporary char that is equal to the first pointer
i then switch the first pointer to the second pointer 
I then set the second pointer to the temporary char which was the first pointer
causing both values to swap 

select min
i have a min pointer and it starts at the array[0]
i then get the length of the array and using the length make a forloop to go through every element in the array
if the current value of min is greater than the next value the new min value becomes that
this results in going through the whole array to get the smallest val and return that pointer

str sort 
I get the length of the string
make a forloop that goes throughj the entire string
then i make a min pointer that is the min of the str at pointer str+i
then i do swap str+i with min val to move the smallest value to the front
because of str+i once the smallest is in the front it takes the strong excluding that value and will return the next smallest value using selectmin(str+i).
