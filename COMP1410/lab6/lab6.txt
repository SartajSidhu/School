create student 
first i create a struct student pointer
I then allocate memory using malloc and 1 since im making one student
I then allocate memory for the name of the length of the given name
I then set the pointer of the id equal to the given id
and the pointer of the name equal to the given name 

free student
I first free the name then free the student, i free the name first to avoid memory leak
I then set the student to null

change name
I allocate enough memory for the new name using malloc
I then check if the name is null, if it is I return false
if not then i copy the new name onto the students name since it now has enougn memory to do so and return true

run times
create student is O(n) since I use strlen on the name
free student is O(1) since free() is O(1)
change name is O(n^2) since I use strlen on the new name and then str cpy on the name
