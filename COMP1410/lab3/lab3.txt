matrix add
since both matrixs must be n x 3 size
i used to for loops one to go through the rows (n) and one to go through each element in each row 
using the nested for loops i can look at each specific index of an nx3 array
so I just added the first array and the second array into the new array all at the same index for every index
this results in adding the values of each array together creating the new sum array

negate column
since the matrix must be n x3 that means the max columns is 3
therefor i can use the same nested for loops used in matrix add to go through the array
but this time i check if j==c 
c is the given column  to negate
if they are equal i will make the array at that specific index *-1
it will do this every time j=c until the array has been fully passed through
 resulting in the whole column = to get multiplied by -1 

negate row
since the matrix must be n x3 that means the max columns is 3
therefor i can use the same nested for loops used in matrix add to go through the array
but this time since we are checking with rows i use i==r
r is the given row to negate
there for if i==r then i set the pointer value to what it was *-1 
each time j iterates i also add 1 to a so that it will keep going to the next value
