create node 
I allocate memory for a node I then copy the guiven string onto that node and make the next pointer for that nodes next and i return the node

free node 
I save what the next node is with a pointer of next 
I then free the current node
Then i return the next node to keep going until next is null

concat nodes
I check if its null if it is I return
if not I then add the old string and the string wanting to be added
I then check if the next is null, if it isnt I add a space 
this is so at the end there isnt an extra space
I then recurse it by calliung concat nodes onto the next node
this will keep going until the last node is reached

run times
create runs in O(n) since it uses strcpy
freenode runs in O(n) aswell since it depends how many nodes are linked
concat runs in O(n) since it uses how many nodes are linked
